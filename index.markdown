![smiley](/assets/ivan-square.png){:height="220px" width="140px" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px"}  Hey!, thanks for stopping by! I'm Iván and here you will find more information about my research and past work.  

Originally from Argentina, I am a PhD Researcher at [Confirm Centre](https://confirm.ie) for the [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie) with focus on “Smart Manufacturing”. I hold a degree in Information Systems Engineering from [UTN.BA](https://frba.utn.edu.ar/) (GPA: 7.54/10) and also worked as a Software Engineer at the industry for over 10 years. 
I also enjoy teaching, as I truly believe to give something back to the institution gave me the chance to pursue a researcher career. That's why I worked as a T.A for the following MSc modules: "Theory and Practice of Advanced AI Ecosystems", "Data Science", "Probabilistic and Explainable AI" and "Intro to Programming" (University of Limerick).

My research interests include Model-Driven Development, Machine Learning and general software engineering related topics.
