**Welcome!** 

![smiley](/assets/ISoLA-2022-Ivan.jpg){:height="220px" width="140px" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px"}  Hey!, nice to e-meet you! I'm Iv√°n Guevara from Buenos Aires (Argentina) and I'm a 4th year PhD student at the [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie) (UL), doing research for the [Smart Manufacturing Research Centre](https://confirm.ie/), located in Castletroy (Limerick - Ireland). My research involves a wide range of topics such as Model-Driven Development, Machine Learning (including Evolutionary Computing) and also several software engineering related topics.

Four years ago, having finished my Information Systems Engineering degree from [UTN.BA](https://frba.utn.edu.ar/), and still working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Hexacta](https://www.hexacta.com/), I was given a scholarship to pursue an [Advanced Course in AI](http://acai2019.tuc.gr/) sponsored by the [EurAI](https://eurai.org/), something that truly changed the course of my whole career. 

In November 2019, I joined the SCCE Limerick Team at UL, leaded by [Prof. Tiziana Margaria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiziana-margaria-9044a12/) with the chance to do novel edge-cutting research. After four great years, and having fulfilled all the requirements to finish my PhD, coming back to the tech industry would be a great new beginning for me.
